A boat enclosure is a group of connected canvas panels that attach to a bimini
or overhead structure, which completely or partially enclose a section of a
boat. Enclosure panels typically include a large window, made from soft or
semi-rigid plastic, which can often be removed or rolled up.

All of our enclosures are custom-built, using premium materials that resist
corrosion from salt, and damage from UV light.

## More than just marine

We also make drop-in enclosure panels for patios, porches, and decks. Drop
panels are a flexible way to add screens, windows, and privacy to your outdoor
space.
