A boat enclosure is a group of connected canvas panels that attach to a bimini
or overhead structure, which completely or partially enclose a section of a
boat. A typical enclosure panel has a large window made from soft or semi-rigid
plastic, which can often be removed or rolled up.

All of our enclosures are custom-built, using premium materials that resist
corrosion from salt, and damage from UV light.

## More than just marine

We also make enclosures for patios, porches, and decks. Drop panels are a
flexible way to add screens, windows, and privacy to your outdoor space.
