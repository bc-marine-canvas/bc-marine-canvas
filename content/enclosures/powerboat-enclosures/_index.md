Like all enclosures, powerboat enclosures provide protection from the sun, rain,
and wind. A variety of common configurations exist, but the core design is the
same: a bimini or canvas top, supported by a frame or connected to a fixed
overhead surface, attached to a series of canvas window panels, creating an
enclosure.

In general, the purpose of any enclosure is to keep you out of the elements.

However, in comparison to a sailboat enclosure, a powerboat enclosure has two
additional responsibilities: to keep the dashboard dry, and to protect the
upholstery.
