Foam decking is a popular option for boat owners who want a durable and
long-lasting deck surface. Foam flooring is typically made of closed-cell foam
that is coated with a textured top layer to provide a non-slip surface.
This type of decking is lightweight, rugged, and provides excellent shock
absorption.
