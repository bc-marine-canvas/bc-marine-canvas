Is your boat ready for guests? If not, it's time to give your cushions and
upholstery new life. We use the finest marine grade fabrics and vinyls that
will withstand years of sun and fun.

We can replicate your existing cushions, or we'll work with you to design a new
look. Add a personal touch to your design with embroidery and custom stitching.
