We love our life on the water, and we know you do too. We're a family business
in Rhode Island, and we specialize in custom marine canvas and upholstery. We
aim to create distinctive, long-lasting enclosures, dodgers, biminis, covers,
and cushions.

We understand that your boat is an extension of your style and personality, and
we hold our work to the highest standard. We will work closely with you to make
your vision a reality, enhancing your investment for years of enjoyment.
