Covers protect your boat (and things on your boat) from the environment. They
vary widely in size, with the largest covering the entire vessel, down to small
covers and bags, and anywhere in between.

Canvas is a uniquely well-suited material for protecting your boat and equipment
from moisture due to its breathability. Canvas covers won't trap moisture, which
helps to prevent the growth of mold and mildew.
