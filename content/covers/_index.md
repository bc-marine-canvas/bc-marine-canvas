Covers are great way to protect your boat from the environment. They range in
size, with the largest covering the entire vessel (think a winter cover), down
to small covers and bags (think a winch cover or sheet bag), and anywhere in
between.

A well-constructed, correctly fitting cover provides effective protection from
the elements. Canvas a uniquely well-suited material for this application, due
to its breathability. Canvas covers won't trap moisture, which helps to prevent
the growth of mold and mildew.
