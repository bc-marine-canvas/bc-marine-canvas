A boat cover is one of the most basic and essential canvas accessories there is.
Just about every boat has at least one cover, usually more.

Covers are the primary means of adding protection from the environment. They
range in size, with the largest covering the entire vessel (think a winter
cover), down to small covers and bags (think a winch cover or sheet bag), and
anywhere in between.

A well-constructed, correctly fitting cover provides effective protection from
the elements, but what makes canvas a uniquely well-suited cover material is its
breathability. Canvas covers won't trap moisture, which helps to prevent the
growth of mold and mildew.
