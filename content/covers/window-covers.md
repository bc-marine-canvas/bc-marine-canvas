Window and windshield covers offer comfort, privacy, protection, and
convenience.

<!--more-->

Fixed windows have the obvious drawback of not being openable. You'll come
across fixed windows in the form of portholes, as well as on boats with
windshields that attach to a hardtop. On a hot and sunny day, these types of
windows draw in heat and sunlight. Window and windshield covers are an effective
way to control how much light enters your boat's interior.

For windows that do open, screens and mesh covers provide shade and privacy, as
well as ventilation and airflow.
