Window and windshield covers offer comfort, privacy, protection, and
convenience.

<!--more-->

Portholes and windshields that attach to a hardtop are examples of fixed
windows that are commonly found on boats. On a hot and sunny day, fixed
windows, or windows that cannot be opened, draw in heat and sunlight. Since
these windows don't open, the adjacent space can become uncomfortably hot.
Instead of a cool breeze, a window or windshield cover or shade can keep you
cool by limiting how much sunlight enters your boat's interior.

For windows that do open, screens and mesh covers provide shade and privacy, as
well as ventilation and airflow.
