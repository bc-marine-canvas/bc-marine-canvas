On the surface, shrink wrap might seem like the most cost effective way to
protect your boat for the winter season. Shrink wrap seems less expensive until
you start thinking about shrink wrap as an annual cost. Often, a canvas cover
will pay for itself within five years, and last for many years to come.

## Benefits of a canvas winter cover

In addition to the potential cost savings, a canvas cover has other benefits
that make it an attractive alternative to plastic shrink wrap:

- Canvas covers provide easier physical access than shrink wrap
- You can put on and take off your winter cover by yourself
- Canvas covers are reusable and don't generate waste each year
- Canvas won't trap moisture and prevents mold and mildew
