On the surface, shrink wrap might seem like the most cost effective way to
protect your boat when it's on the hard. Compared to a canvas winter cover,
shrink wrap is less expensiveâ€”until you start thinking about shrink wrap as an
annual cost.

On average, a canvas winter cover will pay for itself within five years. If
cared for, a winter cover can last 20 years or more. Even estimating
conservatively, a winter cover that lasts 15 years will pay for itself two or
three times over.

## Benefits of a canvas winter cover

In addition to the potential cost savings, a canvas cover has other benefits
that make it an attractive alternative to plastic shrink wrap:

- Canvas covers provide better access without awkward smile entries
- You can put on and take off your winter cover by yourself
- Canvas covers are reusable and don't generate waste each year
- Canvas won't trap moisture and prevents mold and mildew
