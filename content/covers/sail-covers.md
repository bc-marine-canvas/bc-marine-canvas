To protect your mainsail from birds, UV light, and moisture, pack it away into
a sail cover or stackpack when it's not in use.

<!--more-->

Precise fit is critical feature of a mainsail cover or stackpack. Sail covers
frequently occupy the space directly above a dodger or bimini, and clearance is
often limited. Our sail covers are exactly designed to fit your boat, and
ruggedly reinforced to resist chafing and wear.
