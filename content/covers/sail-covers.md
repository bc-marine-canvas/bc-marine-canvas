Sail covers are pretty self-explanatory: to protect your mainsail from birds,
UV light, and moisture, pack it away into a sail cover or stackpack when not in
use.

Precise fit is critical feature of a mainsail cover or stackpack. Sail covers
frequently occupy the space directly above a dodger or bimini, and clearance is
often limited. Ensuring adequate clearance is essential to prevent excessive
wear from friction.

Adequate reinforcement is equally important. Sail covers are often susceptible
to chafing from the topping lift; a correctly designed sail cover will account
for this possibility, and include reinforcement to resist wear.
