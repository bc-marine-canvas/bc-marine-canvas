Powerboat enclosures are essential for many boaters. Not only do they keep you
out of the elements, they protect your equipment and upholstery from the wind,
rain, and sun. They can even extend your boating season.

Keep your dashboard dry and protect your upholstery with an enclosure for your
powerboat. We design custom enclosures to fit your specific boat and your
specific needs, from frame to fasteners.
