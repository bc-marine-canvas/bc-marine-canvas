A dodger (also called a "spray hood") is a partial enclosure found on a
sailboat, usually made from canvas. Its purpose is to keep the companionway
dry, and to keep the cockpit safe from wind and spray.

Depending on the construction and design, dodgers usually fall into one of three
common styles:

- Hardtop dodgers, which have a rigid roof that isn't made of canvas
- California-style dodgers, which have removable side panels that aren't sewn in
- Traditional dodgers, which are fully attached

Often, the dodger is accompanied by a bimini towards the aft of the cockpit,
which provides additional protection from the elements. Dodgers and biminis may
be joined by a canvas connector.
