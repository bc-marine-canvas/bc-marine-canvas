## IMAR Strataglass Cleaner (#301)

Vinyl windows can be harmed and even permanently damaged by products like
sunscreen, bug spray, canvas conditioners, and so on. To avoid permanent
damage, we recommend taking caution when handling your vinyl windows. When it
comes to cleaning, we exclusively recommend IMAR Strataglass Cleaner #301.

## Frame Sox

Protect your vinyl windows and canvas from sun scorching with Frame Sox:
a soft fabric wrapper that wraps around a bimini frame, to prevent your
enclosure from coming in direct contact with hot aluminum.

We make Frame Sox in our shop. A pack of Frame Sox includes two 6-foot-long
"sox", which can be trimmed to fit after installation. They are available in
black, beige, and charcoal.
