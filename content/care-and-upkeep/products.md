Dirt, fingerprints, smudges, and mildew are an unavoidable part of boating.
Sooner or later, someone will brush up against a window panel or stand on a seat
cushion. Restoring your canvas and upholstery to pristine condition is easy, as
long as you select reliable, safe cleaning products.

## IMAR Strataglass Cleaner (#301)

Strataglass in particular is tricky to clean. Vinyl windows can be harmed and
even permanently damaged by products like sunscreen, bug spray, canvas
conditioners, and so on. To avoid permanent damage, we exclusively recommend
IMAR Strataglass Cleaner #301.

When it comes to cleaners, we advise caution. It's generally a good idea to test
any cleaners, polishes, or similar products in a small, discreet area before
proceeding with a full application.

## Frame Sox

Protect your vinyl windows and canvas from sun scorching with Frame Sox:
a soft fabric wrapper that wraps around a bimini frame, to prevent your
enclosure from coming in direct contact with hot aluminum.

We make Frame Sox in our shop. A pack of Frame Sox includes two 6-foot-long
"sox", which can be trimmed to fit after installation. They are available in
black, beige, and charcoal.
