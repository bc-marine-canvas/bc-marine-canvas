safe from scorching.

## IMAR Strataglass Cleaner (#301)

Remove fingerprints, smudges, dirt, and debris from your Strataglass windows
with IMAR Strataglass Cleaner #301. This is the only product we recommend for
cleaning Strataglass, isinglass, or other vinyl windows.

## Frame Sox

Protect your vinyl windows and canvas from sun scorching with Frame Sox:
a soft fabric wrapper that wraps around your bimini frame, and prevents your
enclosure from coming in direct contact with hot aluminum.

We make Frame Sox in our shop. A pack of Frame Sox includes two 6-foot-long
"sox", which can be trimmed to fit after installation. They are available in
black, beige, and charcoal.
