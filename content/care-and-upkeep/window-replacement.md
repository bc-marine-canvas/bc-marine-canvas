If you have damaged windows but don't want to replace your entire enclosure,
consider window replacement instead. Often, we can cleanly swap out your old
windows with new ones without making major changes to the rest of the panel.

This type of repair comes with some benefits and some drawbacks. Window
replacement repairs can be done very quickly, and because the panel isn't
altered, there's little chance of issues with fit or finish.

On the other hand, repairs of this nature can be expensive, depending on the
quantity of glass. In addition, although we achieve a clean result, sometimes
it's not possible to avoid a raw edge.
