If you have damaged windows but don't want to replace your entire enclosure,
consider window replacement instead. Often, we can cleanly swap out your old
windows with new ones, while preserving your existing window panels.

Compared to an entirely new enclosure, a window
replacement repair can be done very quickly. And, because the panel isn't
altered, there's little chance of issues with fit or finish.

On the other hand, window replacement is inevitably a temporary solution. If
you're looking to get a few more years out of your enclosure, get in touch with
us to see if a window replacement is right for your enclosure.
